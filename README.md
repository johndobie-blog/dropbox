##### Organise Dropbox Photos

By default dropbox drops all your new uploads into a single directory.

It does however timestamp them.

You can run this to create yearly and monthly sub folders.
This will process all of the files in the passed in camera uploads folder.
If a file has a filename in the correct format ,  it will be moved into a new sub folder.

For example, 2019-11-17 14.30.17.jpg will be moved into /2019/11
